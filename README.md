# Trade Tracker

Trade Tracker is a web app that allows users to create accounts and create logs of cryptocurrency trades, inputting data ranging from price at/date of purchase, price at/date of sale, and name/symbol of cryptocurrency, along with any notes regarding the transaction.
After the log is input into the database, the profit/loss of each trade is calculated and displayed on the trades index.
Users may make each log public /or private. In addition, users may view other traders' profiles and notes.
